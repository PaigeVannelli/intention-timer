### A simple tool to help you manage time.
********************************************************************************
Intention Timer is a visual tool that helps you manage time and tasks.


### But why?
********************************************************************************
This simple tool was created to give users an easy way to track and manage activities.


###  How does it work?
********************************************************************************
The user has options!

On the home page, after selecting a category, the user inputs their chosen activity and time duration. When the `START ACTIVITY` button is clicked, the user is taken to a new page which displays their input description and a timer, with a big round `START` button.

From there, the user may click `LOG ACTIVITY` to save their input card to the page. They may then create a New Activity by clicking `CREATE NEW ACTIVITY`. This button click will return the user to the home screen and they can begin again!

Past Activities will be stored in `localStorage` and displayed as a card on the right side of the page to help keep track of what has already been accomplished!

### How did we do this?
********************************************************************************
Working remotely, our team used Atom and the Teletype extension to work together on code, Zoom calls for chatting, and Slack to share our insights and schedule meetings.

In addition, we made space for one another to ask questions, explained code another team member didn't quite understand, and commiserated about the happenings of the day. We got along well as a team and were able to make good decisions as a group and build rapport as classmates.


### Technologies we used
********************************************************************************
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS


### Goals and Objectives
********************************************************************************
- Gain an understanding of how to write DRY HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using `localStorage` and JSON
- Understand how to use a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
- Incorporate and iterate over arrays to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP


### Future Iterations
********************************************************************************
- Allow users to add comments to their intention session that will display on Past Activities cards
- Allow users to favorite certain cards and repeat a session with the same requirements
- Allow users to pause the timer and resume at a later time
- Add animation to the timer to visualize the time remaining
